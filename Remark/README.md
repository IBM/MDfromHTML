## Remark Project Read Me ##

This project provides html to markdown transformation. It is based on the Apache 2.0 licensed Remark project found [here][here]  

Note: there is a later version in github found [here][here1] but I have not yet incorporated its updates.

### Building this project ###
Generate the jar files in your maven repository by right clicking on the pom.xml file and selecting Run as... / Maven build... and use the **clean install** goals. This will create jars in the target directory as well as in the ~/.m2/repository directory tree:

  * remark-1.0.9-jar-with-dependencies.jar
  * remark-1.0.9.jar
